# BI_Project_1sem
Repositoty for the first semester project.



For research was used data from this paper:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418313941#app2

Data for responders and non-responders is in the git repository.

For investigation was used iTalk library:
https://github.com/Coolgenome/iTALK/tree/master/data

The aim of the study was to compare data on gene expression in people who respond to checkpoint immunotherapy and those who do not. Hypothesis: People who respond to such immunotherapy will have changes in the expression of genes involved in the regulation of the immune system.
The iTalk package allows you to find ligand-receptor pairs (using the built-in database of such interactions). Thus, we can find genes for proteins localized on the membrane and involved in signaling.
Thus, a change in the expression of the HAVCR2 and CTLA4 genes, which are genes of checkpoint proteins, was found in the respondents. Differences were also found for checkpoint ligands and tumor necrosis factors: LGALS9,
CD274, CD80/CD86, TNFSF9.
